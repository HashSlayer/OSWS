A powerful Python-based automation and education tool designed to make computer tasks easier while teaching programming concepts.

## ðŸ¤– Features

- Computer task automation
- Python programming education
- Interactive learning environment
- User-friendly interfaces, learn how to use Tkinter

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python
- Tkinter library

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Star the repository

Welcome to Old School Walk Scape, a fun interactive way to learn Python.
This guide uses a 2007 point-click game to learn Python. The concepts can be applied to other games or automative tasks.
This guide will not cover computer science concepts, complex algorithms, or complex automation. We will avoid using complex libraries such as color bots.

OSWS; OSRS scripting bot for various skills. Created to improve GUI automation, made for educational purposes

Welcome to Mekail The Machine's basic OSRS skilling and computer automation scripting kit using python.

It was optimized to run on a screen with 1920 x 1080 resolution, features to translate coordiantes manullay have been deprecated.
The script is safe to use on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

Make sure to open this folder in the terminal any type pip install -r requirements.txt after succesfully installing python. From there run any file with bot logic by double clicking the file, or running it through an IDE.
