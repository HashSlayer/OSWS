# Old-School-Walk-Scape
OSWS; OSRS scripting bot for various skills. Created to improve GUI automation, and was made for educational purposes only.


This project was a test to initally learn Python through botting various skills, in an old 2007 browser based MMORPG.

This operates through the RuneLite client, at 1920 - 1200 pixels, as well as 1920 - 1080 have both been tested.

Scripts do not use bject detection, or use have 3rd party clients. 

Many scripts may require a fully zoomed camerea facing True North, and some at specific locations. 
File may be updated in the future for that reference, but scripts were used to succesfully achieve 99 skill level
Without getting banned, succesfully implementing the use of randomization, and mimicing of human like behaviour
on a smaller script scale. I am impressed they worked as well as they did without using object detection, but 
do not recommend running these for any reasons other than educational purposes.
