Welcome to Mekail The Machine's basic OSRS skilling script using 100% python.

The script does not use object detection, and is recommend to run over RuneLite client, on 1920 x 1080 resolution.

In darts.py the script is designed to click between the 15th and 16th item in the inventory slot; and is only programmed to take
short breaks between extensive clicks. It is designed to click different locations in random time parameters; moving in a diagonal fashion
with varying slopes and speeds to help reduce any bot detenction. More measures could certainly be implemented, but this was not made
for the inteded use of bot farming. This script was ran over a period of 2 weeks, for a couple hours a day, on a fresh account to 99.
